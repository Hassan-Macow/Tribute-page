# Responsive web design (Freecodecamp projects)

This repository contains my Tribute page project 
and other code challenges under it.
these activities belong to Freecodecamp Responsive Web Design that 
will instruct developers on how to build websites 
that adapt to various screen sizes by constructing a number of projects.

First, you'll build a cat photo app to learn the basics of HTML and CSS.
Later, you'll learn modern techniques like CSS variables by building
a penguin, and best practices for accessibility by building a quiz site.

Finally, you'll learn how to make webpages that respond to different screen
 sizes by building a photo gallery with Flexbox, and a magazine 
 article layout with CSS Grid.
